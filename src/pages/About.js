      ðŸ‘‹ I'm Reece Renninger. I am a United States Marine Corps veteran who is becoming a Full-Stack JavaScript Developer while attending Code Fellows Seattle. I attended California State University Long Beach from 2017 to 2020 where I earned a BA in Psychology. After I was exposed to the field of User Psychology, I became fascinated with being able to apply psychological methods to coding design and implementation.
